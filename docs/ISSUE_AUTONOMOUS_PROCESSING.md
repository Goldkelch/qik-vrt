# Autonomous issue processing contract

## Effect

Every newly opened, reopened, or edited non-pull-request issue triggers the repository-native issue processor. Existing issues can be processed through `workflow_dispatch` with their issue number.

The processor:

1. fetches the authoritative GitHub issue payload;
2. materializes a canonical request and SHA-256 evidence;
3. gathers deterministic, size-bounded repository context;
4. compiles only a deterministic, schema- and policy-bounded work-unit disposition;
5. emits truthful status metadata;
6. validates the evidence bundle and no-false-pass rules;
7. creates or updates `issue-agent/<number>`;
8. opens a reviewable pull request;
9. comments the status and PR URL on the issue.

## Non-negotiable gates

- No automatic merge.
- No automatic issue closure.
- Model failure produces `BLOCK`, not a fabricated answer.
- Generated work remains `CONTINUE` until repository checks and human review establish a stronger state.
- The issue payload and its digest remain part of the committed evidence.
- Formal derivation, repository evidence, hypothesis, and empirical confirmation must remain distinguishable.

## Authentication and deterministic compilation

The workflow uses GitHub's ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write`, `issues: write`, and `pull-requests: write`. It invokes no external model. A request without a tested, allowlisted deterministic handler becomes `BLOCKED_WITH_NEXT_ACTION` with the first causal blocker and next native event.

## Processing an existing issue

Run **Autonomous issue processing** manually and supply the issue number. This is required for issues that predate the workflow, including issue #76.

## Evidence location

Each processing run writes:

```text
evidence/issues/<number>/
├── REQUEST.json
├── REQUEST.sha256
├── CONTEXT.md
├── ANSWER.md
└── STATUS.json
```

The generated branch and PR are work products, not evidence of correctness by themselves.
